Running on `Ropsten Testnet`, contract address [0x34bdced976429993238aeb44347a8f9ce23d25d2](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x34bdced976429993238aeb44347a8f9ce23d25d2)

# Lazy Loose Money

Let say that i want to do running for 1 hour everyday for 100 days. I create a contract and deposit $100 in it. Everyday, I need to (somehow) inform the contract that I finish my running or not. Then after 100 days passed, depend on the completeness of my report, the contract will do some punishment. For example: lock $100 for 10 more-day for each day I did not do the running. So if I skip running for 6 day, the money will be lock there for 2-months. Other kinds of punishment could be: Burn a part of deposit money, give it to someone ...

I'm thinking of asking a friend (roommate for example) to do the checking for me. And how should I incentive my friend to inform the contract regularly and CORRECTLY?

**Here is a solution**

* If I cancel my commitment, I will loose half of my deposit money.

* If I keep my commitment contract run till the end:

    - My friend will get a portion of deposit money according to the number of days reported to the contract.

    - I will get the portion of deposit money according to the number of days I finished my commitment.

Later, we can add more features:
* Supporters can visit and give the commitment some fund.
* I can blame the guardian (did not report correctly, ...) and both I him will loose money ...
* More than one person can be guardians, and guradians can co-report me commitment. The more guradians join, the stronger my committent is.

## More game theory
To avoid troll guardian (not implemented yet):
* Guardian need to deposit some money
* committer can `complain` if guardian reported wrongly. In this case both committer and guardian loose money
* After complain for 3 times, committer can `fire` his guardian to find a more realiable one
